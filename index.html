          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
              Spaniel Boone is the nom de plume of Daniel Gregg (me). My interests and work focus on several activities, all with elements of socially-focused enterprises. </br></br>
              
              <strong>Research in economics</strong></br>
              I have a PhD in economics with a focus on sustainable agriculture and environmental services. In recent years my focus in this area is on inclusive and sustainable development interventions with particular interest in how economic systems can better target disadvantaged households in rural areas of developing countries.</br><a href="#research">See more.</a></br></br>
    
              <strong>Ethical (specialty) coffee supply chains</strong></br>
              Innovations developed through my research have led to opportunities to apply those insights to generate impact in rural development. Over the last 3 years I have worked with colleagues and business partners to develop an ethical, smallholder-inclusive, coffee supply chain enterprise. Additionally, my work in this area incorporates approaches to community-ownership of supply chains and alternative, more community-focused, approaches to foreign direct investment models.</br><a href="#impact">See more.</a> </br></br>
    
              <strong>ICT-based innovations in research and rural development</strong></br>
              I seek to leverage ICT to improve the efficiency and scope of application of economic innovations for rural development and research. This includes applications of full-stack development to conduct online economic 'laboratory' experiments and, more recently, the conceptualisation of SaaS platforms to provide for digitisation and automation of supply chain procurement and payments.</br><a href="#apps">See more.</a>

          <div id="research">
            My <strong>economic research</strong> interests cover three main areas:</br></br>
              <em>Rural Development:</em><br>
                My research in rural development is focused on identifying the constraints to acheiving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in rural areas. In particular, my interest is on why many interventions fail to target the most disadvantaged groups, and on achieving equality in access to development programs for these groups. </br></br>
              <em>Behavioural phenomena</em></br>
                A substantial portion of my research work is focused on how non-rational behaviours influence choices in an economic context. This research area uses experimental methods and behavioural interventions to understand the intra-personal and psycho-social drivers of aspects such as savings choices, consumption decisions, household relationships, investment decisions, land management, and more.</br></br>
              <em>Econometric and impact analysis</em></br>
                A major area of my expertise is in the analysis of economic phenomena using statistical methods ('econometrics') and the design of survey tools/intervention strategies to provide data for econometric analysis and/or impact evaluation.
          </div>
          <div id="impact">
            My <strong>impact</strong> activities are focused on commercialisation and implementation of supply chain innovations for inclusive economic development. </br></br>
            
            A major portion of these activities are associated with an ethical, specialty, coffee enterprise operating a smallholder-inclusive coffee supply chain currently based out of Uganda. 
          </br></br>

          <strong>Intersection Traders Pty. Ltd.</strong> </br></br>
          
            <a href="https://intersectiontraders.com/"><img src="assets/traders.png"></a></br>
            The approach of Intersection Traders embodies concepts developed in research activities and seeks to provide a showcase of both the potential for smallholder-inclusive supply chains to compete against traditional supply chains and for economic research to generate substantial change.</br></br>

            Currently in the second year of operations, Intersection Traders has a rapidly growing specialty coffee supply chain that provides far greater access to high-value coffee markets for smallholder/disadvantaged groups than other existing approaches. Operating as a leasehold program means that community ownership of assets is guaranteed in the future. 
          </div>
          <div id="apps">
            My <strong>ICT applications</strong> are focused on innovations that leverage digital technologies to achieve improvements in inclusivity and efficiency of supply chains and on providing improved tools for economic analysis/insights. </br></br>

            <strong> ADaPT</strong> (Automatic Disbursements and Procurement Tracking tool) is currently being developed to facilitate widespread adoption of supply chain innovations that provide for profitable engagement with smallholders and disadvantaged groups. (link coming soon) </br>

            <strong>Econ-Lab</strong> is an experimental economics platform that utilises a PostgreSQL-Python-Django-Bootstrap stack to provide online serving of economic experiments. Econ-Lab is in the process of developing linkages to other enterprises that will allow access to representative samples in order to improve the external validity of economic experiments into the future. </br>
