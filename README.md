# Daniel Gregg Portfolio Page V1

This repository contains the first version of a portfolio focused on exhibiting web-development skills and other expertise for myself (Daniel Gregg). 

The website contained within this repository has limited functionality currently. Whilst internal links (to different page sections) work, the only external link working is for the Intersection Traders website. This is accessed by clicking on the coffee branch logo below the Intersection Traders title. 

The remaining links will be updated over time with new versions of this portfolio. 

The layout is based on a desktop view with a sidebar navigation pane. The header section contains a logo fading out with a nom-de-plume ('Spaniel Boone') alternately fading in (repeated infinitely). 

In the content section there is a main 'about me' section with links to my main areas of work: research, impact and applications. These additional elements are located in a flexbox below the 'about me' section that is responsive to screen size. 

For screens smaller than 600px a different style sheet was created that removes the sidebar and instead places the navigation links in a fixed header below the fading logo.
